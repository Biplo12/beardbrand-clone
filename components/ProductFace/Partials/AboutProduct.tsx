        New name, new packaging; same legendary product.
      </h1>
      <p>
        We put our legendary lightweight, non-greasy Beard Oil blend of
        abyssinian, jojoba, castor, and babassu oils in a 4 oz. aluminum bottle
        and re-dubbed it Utility Oil. Why? Because it`s too darn good to only
        use in your beard. With a bigger bottle and a better price per ounce,
        this is the only oil you`ll ever need to keep your beard, hair, and skin
        hydrated, nourished, and smelling awesome. It`s basically a bottle of
        liquid gold for your beard, hair, and skin. Utility Oil comes with a
        pump dispenser.

      <p>
        Growth doesn`t come easily. There are setbacks, defeats, and valuable
        lessons along the way. Every bump, bruise, scar, broken bone, and broken
        heart tells a story and should be worn with pride. That same philosophy
        applies to Beardbrand packaging. Your aluminum bottles and jars will
        dent and get dinged up along the way. We see it as a reminder to not
        hide from our scars and imperfectionsâ€”but to embrace them.
